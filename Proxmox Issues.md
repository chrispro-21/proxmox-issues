- Issues with Proxmox VE (YES I KNOW Most of these are VMWare features)
	- GUI #GUI
		- VM Management
		  id:: cb153688-4ce9-4989-9a4c-46d8d1201bb3
			- Cannot sort VMs by #Essential
				- Datastore
				- Network
				- Host
			- No Import or Export of VM through OVA in GUI #Essential
			- Warning that Proxmox QEMU Guest Agent is not installed
				- Install Proxmox QEMU Tools as a button #Would-be-nice
			- When selecting Guest OS, display the icon
			- Use VM name instead of ID / hide ID
				- Ties in with ((63f398b7-38c2-4fe8-a051-fa159553854a))
				- ALLOW SPACES IN THE NAME
		- Leaving Cluster is a massive pain in the ass #Essential
		- No Datastore Browser #Would-be-nice
		  id:: 1fb48e83-d24a-4b02-9a9d-0e94d31b9e1d
		- Head #Would-be-nice
			- No advanced setup by head like [Xen xsconsole](https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp) / VMware
	- Storage #Issues
		- ISCSI Storage cannot act as filesystem for storage of ISOs and files #Would-be-nice
		- VM configs not stored with VM files #Essential
			- ((1fb48e83-d24a-4b02-9a9d-0e94d31b9e1d)) Cannot import VM from datastore on another server
				- Proxmox Backup Server has something like this for their datastore browser
	- Backend
		- Backups
			- Cannot create/restore host config from backup natively from GUI #Essential
				- XML/tarDB download would be nice
					- Examples
						- TrueNAS
						- pfSense
		- Why is the VM-id not unique #Would-be-nice
		  id:: 63f398b7-38c2-4fe8-a051-fa159553854a
			- Ties in with ((cb153688-4ce9-4989-9a4c-46d8d1201bb3))
			- All Start at 100 for new install
				- Possible options
					- random integer from uuid
					- Use smBIOS ID
	- Multi Cluster Management #GUI
		- [Currently in progress](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Roadmap#Roadmap)
	- Networking
		- VLAN management
		- Distributed Switches #GUI
			- GUI for central Networking management #Would-be-nice
				- add host to switch
